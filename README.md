# PyChatBot
So this is my first ever Pybot using Pytorch,nltk. These are the contents of this project:

1.intents.json: Data file contaning messages and replies for training the model in json format thats how usually the data comes from API.

2.nltk_utils: It uses the basic functions of NLP like stemming,word vectors etc. basically preprocessing the text.

3.model.py: this has the NeuralNet function involving pytorch inbuilt fucntions of layers

4.train.py: training the model for the very first time and saving the existing state of the model in **data.pth** file

5.chat.py: run the file and start talking to your chat bot.

I have used basic deep learning model and algorithms to make this happen.

I hope you will enjoy !!!
